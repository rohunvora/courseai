# Prompt Test Runner Updates

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Mocks and Fallbacks
✅ **Verified real OpenAI API calls**: The test runner was already using real OpenAI API calls via the `openai` library, not mocks.

✅ **Enhanced error handling**: Removed error-hiding patterns and added transparent error reporting with full stack traces.

### 2. API Configuration Updates
✅ **Dynamic model selection**: Changed from hardcoded `gpt-4-turbo-preview` to use `config.openai.model` from environment configuration.

✅ **API key validation**: Added explicit validation that OpenAI API key is configured before attempting any calls.

### 3. Enhanced Logging and Debugging
✅ **Detailed API call logging**: Added console output for:
- Model being used
- Number of messages in context
- Token usage from responses
- Tool calls made by the AI
- Response previews
- Tool call arguments

✅ **Error transparency**: Enhanced error handling to:
- Log full error details including API error responses
- Provide stack traces for debugging
- Exit with proper error codes

### 4. Scenario Loading Improvements
✅ **Path validation**: Added logging to show exactly which scenario files are being loaded
✅ **File existence checks**: Explicit validation that scenario files exist before attempting to parse
✅ **Loading confirmation**: Clear feedback when scenarios are successfully loaded

### 5. Test Execution Improvements
✅ **Progress indicators**: Real-time logging of test execution progress
✅ **Result transparency**: Clear indication of test success/failure
✅ **Report generation**: Automatic saving of test results to timestamped files

## Files Modified

- `/tests/prompt-harness/test-runner.ts` - Main test runner with all enhancements
- `/test-prompt-runner.sh` - Helper script for running tests
- `/validate-test-runner.js` - Validation script to check configuration

## How to Use

### Quick Validation
```bash
node validate-test-runner.js
```

### Run Test Harness
```bash
# Direct execution
npx tsx tests/prompt-harness/test-runner.ts

# Or use helper script
./test-prompt-runner.sh
```

### Environment Requirements
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` must be set in `.env` file
- All scenario files must exist in `tests/scenarios/`
- `reports/` directory will be created automatically

## Key Features

### Real API Testing
- Uses actual OpenAI API calls with your configured model
- Real token usage and costs
- Authentic response behavior

### No Hidden Errors
- All failures are logged with full details
- API errors include response details
- No swallowed exceptions
- Proper exit codes for CI/CD integration

### Comprehensive Logging
- Every API call is logged with details
- Tool usage is tracked and reported
- Response content is previewed
- Execution timing is measured

### Production-Ready
- Uses environment configuration
- Handles rate limits and API errors gracefully
- Generates timestamped reports
- Suitable for automated testing pipelines

## Testing Results

The test runner will:
1. Load all scenario files and validate them
2. Execute real OpenAI API calls for each variant
3. Evaluate responses against expected outcomes
4. Generate detailed reports with success rates
5. Save results to timestamped markdown files

Reports include:
- Success rates by prompt variant
- Tool call accuracy metrics
- Response specificity scores
- Safety compliance checks
- Detailed failure analysis
